    <h1>Our ingredients</h1>
    <p>
      At our phở-only restaurant in the heart of Hanoi,
      we take pride in sourcing the freshest ingredients every day.
      Our rich, aromatic broth begins with high-quality local beef,
      paired with crisp, farm-fresh vegetables from Hanoi's vibrant markets.
      Every bowl is a tribute to authentic flavors and time-honored tradition.
